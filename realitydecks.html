project: Reality Decks
sub-title: Virtual Reality DJ Platform
summary: I designed the branding, website and Oculus store placements for a new virtual Reality DJ startup. I began this project by holding a brand strategy meeting with Founder Phil Mac. Following this we iterated through different designs, typographic styles and concepts, evaluating each against Phil's vision and the brand outcomes. I then worked on straplines, followed by design of the actual site and store cards. <p>All the illustrations for the project were also designed bespoke for RealityDecks.</p>

				<p class="work-summary">I worked with consumer electronics companies and studios to implement next-generation audio tech in their games, mobiles, cars, set top boxes and hi-fi equipment</p>
				<p>Collaborating with Jaguar and Bowers and Wilkins we created an in car audio experience where every passenger in the car would feel as if they were sat in the center of a perfect surround sound field. Dolby Pro-Logic IIx upmixing was used in a unique way to translate stereo music into 7.1 inside the car.</p>

								<p>I also worked with European games studios to integrate and launch Dolby Voice / Axon in games. Using headphone virtualisation this 3D voice experience allows you to chat with other players as if they are standing around you in the same room.</p>

			<h2 class="work-section">Brief</h2>
			<p class="work-summary">Vhi are the leading provider of health insurance in Ireland. I worked with Google-partner agency Ribot to create new features for the app and a redesign to bring it in-line with iOS12 and Android Pi.</p>
			<p class="work-summary">Vhi are moving away from being an insurer to a healthcare provider with clinics so I also worked on a vision prototype for how the app could help patients from their initial consultation to experience at a hospital</p>

			<h2 class="work-section">Parkrun</h2>
			<p class="work-summary">The main feature I created was to support a partnership with Parkrun. The concept was to incentivise customers to go running to improve their wellbeing and health. I began by conducting some background research on Parkrun and other products in the running and fitness space.

				</figure>
			<p class="work-summary">It became clear that users were motivated by t-shirts they received from Parkrun, particuarly at a milestone like 100 runs. The community aspect of the events and that achivement is also a large motivator for runners. This helped provide some initial validation around the concept and some pointers to guide the design.

			<p class="work-summary">I explored a cross-section of rewards we could use to motivate users to go running from physical gear to coaching. content and badges.</p>

			<p class="work-summary">Having spent around 6 months working remotely and feeling my fitness dwindling, I decided to get fully immersed taking up running myself and joining a local running group. From talking to other runners I learned that gear is a big point of conversation and running at different times of year and in varying conditions requires different items. Runners also love to wear the gear they get after winning races as a badge of honour.

			<p class="work-summary">The next step was putting together some initial skethces and a low-fidelity prototype. Initally these had the concept of the user earning points which could be redeemed for rewards and badges. Later this was simplified for an MVP to focus purely on physical rewards. </p>

			<p class="work-summary">A higher fidelity concept was then tested by an external testing agency with a number of Vhi and Parkrun customers. Users completed various tasks in the app such as claiming rewards and their repsonses were measured. They were also asked questions about their history with running and motivations for fitness.  </p>

			<p class="work-summary">Some of the interactions in the app were more complex such as linking users Parkrun and Vhi accounts, so I created detailed flows to help solve these.

			Feedback from testing was incorporated into a final visual design which was then put in to development. I explored a number of different designs with Vhi before settling on something that felt clean and on-brand.</p>
			<p class="work-summary">
			The partner Vhi selected for physical rewards did not supply attractive images of the rewards so I reshot all the items using a DSLR and light tent. I also created on-boarding illustrations to ensure that users could easy see how the rewards process worked.</p>

			<p class="work-summary">The MVP of this feature had 25% of all Parkrun users in Ireland sign up in the first week. Vhi have shipped over 1k rewards so far with great feedback from users. On the back of this success, they have now comissioned a second iteration.</p>

			<h2 class="work-section">Vision Prototype</h2>
			<p class="work-summary">The other pieces I worked on Vhi were a redesesign and a future vision of the app to gives users a 5-star experience from seeing a doctor online to visiting one of their new clinics. This started with a workshop I ran at Vhi's offices where we looked at existing issues with the app design, such as multiple-entry point navigation and user/business needs.
